# Bike Sharing

# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to review existing bike-sharing data to see if the program would be successful in Des Moines.  To help the investors understand the program, we looked at data that was available to us which was based on the bike-share program in New York City.  We looked at various data points such as typical checkout times for each bike, peak hours and how many bike trips are there each day of the week.
