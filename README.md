# Bike Sharing

# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to review existing bike-sharing data to see if the program would be successful in Des Moines.  To help the investors understand the program, we looked at data that was available to us which was based on the bike-share program in New York City.  We looked at various data points such as typical checkout times for each bike, peak hours and how many bike trips are there each day of the week.

This graph shows the total number of rides based on the user type which is either a subscriber who pays a monthly fee or someone who pays as they go.  It is great to see the amount of people who subscribe to using the service.  




![](/Peak_hours.png)
This graphs shows the peak hours based on the start time of a ride.  You can see that the peak hours seem to be when people start and end their day.  The busies time is from 5pm to 7pm.  This information helps determine the best time to help service bikes which would be anywhere from 2am to 5am.   




![](/Trip_duration.png)
The above graph shows the average time that a bike is checked out for a rider.  The majority of the rides are under 5 minutes and once the minutes go up, the number of bike rides based on those minutes go down.  When looking at rolling this out in a community, you should look at how far apart things are spread out to determine the average ride.

This trip duration graph shows how long each gender checks out a bike.  More males check out bikes with the most being 5 minutes.  Less females rent out than males but the majority of the females rent the bikes out for 7 minutes.

This first heat map shows what time of day and day of week that have the most bike trips.  I would say that 8am, 5pm and 6pm have the most bike trips during the weekdays.  The weekend starts to pick up activity around 10am and goes until 7pm with Saturday being busier than Sunday.




![](/trips_gender.png)
This second heat map shows the number of bike trips by day, by gender.   As we had seen in the graph showing the average time that each particular gender checks out a bike, it is not a surprise that the male heatmap shows more frequency of bike trips.  This is similar to the previous heat map where 8am, 5pm and 6pm have the most rides and the weekends have most movement from 10am to 8pm.



![](/trips_day.png)
This heat map shows the days with the most bike usage.  The subscribers have the most usgae which makes sense as they pay a monthly fee.  It is not surprise after we have viewed other data that males have the most usage with Thursday being the highest.  Customers usage is the greatest on the weekends which would indicate visitors or the casual locals that are looking for something to do out of their norm.
