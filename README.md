# Bike Sharing

# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to review existing bike-sharing data to see if the program would be successful in Des Moines.  To help the investors understand the program, we looked at data that was available to us which was based on the bike-share program in New York City.  We looked at various data points such as typical checkout times for each bike, peak hours and how many bike trips are there each day of the week.

This graph shows the total number of rides based on the user type which is either a subscriber who pays a monthly fee or someone who pays as they go.  It is great to see the amount of people who subscribe to using the service.

This graphs shows the peak hours based on the start time of a ride.  You can see that the peak hours seem to be when people start and end their day.  The busies time is from 5pm to 7pm.  This information helps determine the best time to help service bikes which would be anywhere from 2am to 5am.

The above graph shows the average time that a bike is checked out for a rider.  The majority of the rides are under 5 minutes and once the minutes go up, the number of bike rides based on those minutes go down.  When looking at rolling this out in a community, you should look at how far apart things are spread out to determine the average ride.
